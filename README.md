# Library Data Visualizations

Uses the bare minimum of Google Forms, Sheets, and [D3](https://d3js.org/) to generate some visualizations of common data collected by Libraries.

## Steps
1. Create your Google form to match one of the templates. Submit your statistics to the form as you do your Library business

1. Modify the template to point to the correct form URL

1. Render your visualization! You can iframe it too.
